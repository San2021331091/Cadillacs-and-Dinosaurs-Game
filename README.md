through various levels, players confront boss fights, employ special moves, and
collect weapons for both melee and ranged combat.Dinosaurs can be neutral or
enemies in the game. When neutral they are in green color; when enraged or
attacking they turn into red colour; when "defeated" they return to green colour and
stop attacking, thus moving off screen. This game typically supports up to three
players.The gameplay seamlessly integrates vehicular segments, allowing players to
hop into Cadillacs for dynamic driving experiences. Cooperative multiplayer adds a
social dimension, enabling friends to join forces. Power-ups, items, and a points
system enhance the gaming experience, while a post-apocalyptic storyline unfolds
through cutscenes, accompanied by vibrant graphics and a fitting soundtrack,
capturing the essence of this nostalgic favourite.In this game,a player experiences
